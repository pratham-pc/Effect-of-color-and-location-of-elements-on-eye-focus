# Visual Communication - End Semester Project.

#### Objective: 
The aim of the project is to collect data of eye-fixations of different people on some predefined images which are based on interaction of basic colors with main areas of focus on a square white background.

#### Introduction:
This project uses an Eye-tracker and the relevant software to handle the data recorded by the eye-tracker. Basically the eye-tracker tracks the eye-movement of the person looking at the screen and also measures the time for which the person looked at a particular point. The approach is to show a set of test images to a number of people, obtain the relevant data from eye tracker, analyse that data using RStudio and generate relevant graphs and pie charts.
